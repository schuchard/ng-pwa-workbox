/**
 * Requests for URLs that aren't precached can be handled by runtime caching.
 * Workbox has a flexible routing system, giving you control over which caching
 * strategies to use for which kind of requests.
 *
 * registerRoute() takes a RegExp or a string as its first parameter.
 *   - RegExps can match any part of the request URL.
 *   - Strings are Express-style routes, parsed by
 *     https://github.com/nightwolfz/path-to-regexp
 *
 * registerRoute() takes a caching strategy as its second parameter.
 * The built-in strategies are:
 *   - cacheFirst
 *   - cacheOnly
 *   - networkFirst
 *   - networkOnly
 *   - staleWhileRevalidate
 * Advice about which strategies to use for various assets can be found at
 * https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/
 *
 * Each strategy can be configured with additional options, controlling the
 * name of the cache that's used, cache expiration policies, which response
 * codes are considered valid (useful when you want to cache opaque responses)
 * and whether updates to previously cached responses should trigger a message
 * using the BroadcastChannel API.
 *
 * The following routes show this flexibility put to use.
